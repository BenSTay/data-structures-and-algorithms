# Get Edges
A C# algorithm challenge implementation.

## Challenge
Given a business trip itinerary (as an array of city names), and an airline route map (as a graph),
determine if the trip is possible with direct flights, and if so, how much will the total trip cost?

## Approach & Implementation
If the array's length is less than 2, return 0 (because no flights will be taken).
Similarly, if the size of the graph is less than 2, return 0 (because you can't take a flight from a city to the same city).


### Big O
- **Time**: O(n)
  - Because getting
- **Space**: O(1)
  - B
